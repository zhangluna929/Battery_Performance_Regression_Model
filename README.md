# Battery Performance Regression Model

This repository provides a comprehensive model for predicting battery performance using a combination of **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost Regressor**. The model is designed to predict key battery performance metrics such as capacity, internal resistance, power density, and more. The solution uses advanced techniques such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model ensembling to improve accuracy and generalization.

## Overview

Battery performance prediction is essential for understanding how a battery will behave under various conditions. This model uses two robust regression models — **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** — and combines their predictions to deliver a more reliable and accurate performance estimate. 

### Key Features:
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Captures complex, non-linear relationships between features.
- **XGBoost Regressor**: Gradient boosting model that is efficient and well-suited for handling large datasets and complex relationships.
- **Feature Selection**: Uses SelectKBest with the F-regression method to select the most significant features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizes the models using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for improved performance.
- **Ensemble Method**: Combines the predictions from both models to make a final prediction that balances their individual strengths.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures the model generalizes well by evaluating it through cross-validation.
